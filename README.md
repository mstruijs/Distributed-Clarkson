# Distributed-Clarkson
Code used in experimental evaluation of distributed Clarkson algorithms for solving LP-type problems

This repository contains the code used to experimentally evaluate the number of rounds required when applying the distributed Clarkson algorithms designed
in the paper _Fast Distributed Algorithms for LP-Type Problems of Bounded Dimension_ by Kristian Hinnenthal, Christian Scheideler, and Martijn Struijs (Submitted to SPAA)

The main code in `distributedLPtypeAlgorithms.py` has no dependencies other than the Python 3 standard library.
Other parts depend on matplotlib for plotting and visualisation.
